# HMO
This repository contains programs for calculating the Hückel Molecular Orbital (HMO) theory using both Fortran and Python. 
HMO theory is a fundamental method in computational chemistry for determining the molecular orbital energies and wavefunctions of conjugated hydrocarbons.

Fortran Implementation: 
The Fortran program is designed to efficiently compute the molecular orbital energies and eigenvectors using the Hückel approximation. Fortran is well-suited for scientific computing due to its high performance and robust numerical capabilities 2.

Python Implementation: 
The Python script provides a more modern and accessible approach to solving the same problem. It leverages Python's simplicity and powerful libraries like NumPy for linear algebra operations, making it easier to understand and modify for educational purposes.
